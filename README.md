TODO:
- FreeCAD support


less importand todo's:
- Decrease filezise by instanced mesh (a lot of models have multiple repeating elements), potential solutions:

	- super smart importer that recognizes similarities;
	- array modifier (e.g. PinSocket 1x1 multiplied to create all other same-type sockets)
